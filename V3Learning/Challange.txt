Tests: The intelligence's ability to learn and store the learned information in memory autonomously.

Use evolution and a 3D neural network to get a network to train itself.

Game rules:
Game engine randomly chooses between 0 and 1:

If 0 the game expects the same input as output:
If 1 the game expects the inverted input as output:

After a random amount of games the value changes. Thus for the next move the intelligences will not be required to provide the correct answer.
This round is only presented as input so that the intelligence can learn that the game has changed.

The bot gets 2 inputs:
Input randomly generated as 0 or 1.
Previous error of 0 or 1. This value is initially 0.

Error is calculated as:
0 if the expected output equals the intelligence output.
1 if the expected output does not equal the intelligence output.

The game works by evolving an intelligence that can successfully learn if it should copy or invert the input for each game, based on the feedback provided.
Thus a complete basic intelligence with memory and learning capabilities is created.
